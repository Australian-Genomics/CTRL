    I understand that the researchers will collect information from my medical records.
  description:
    We will ask the Commonwealth Department of Health for your Medicare (MBS) and Pharmacy (PBS) records,
    covering a period of up to 8 years. We will ask Data Linkage agencies in each State or Territory of Australia
    for your hospital inpatient records and emergency department visit records.
    This information will cover a period of up to 14 years.
    This information will be very important for us to understand how having a genomic test and
    a genomic diagnosis might reduce the long-term costs of health care. Access to the
    information is tightly regulated to protect your privacy, and we only
    receive it after applying for it through the proper channels. We will also be required to destroy it
    after we finish using it.

    I understand that at times during the research project I will be asked to complete surveys or questionnaires.
    Iâ€™ll be reminded when they are ready to complete and I can ask for help to do them.
  description: |
    The surveys and questionnaires will help us understand your views and your understanding of genomic testing,
    as well as your personal experiences of the test.
    We will sometimes ask you questions about the financial costs of clinic visits or
    having your specific health condition.

    I understand that my samples and data may be used in further research when no cause is found as part of the initial test
    and/or when further investigation is required to understand my condition.
  description:
    Your samples and/or data will only be shared for further research that follows the relevant privacy and security requirements,
    and ethical guidelines for biomedical and health research. Your data and samples will be shared without any personal information (eg name),
    however they will be coded so if needed they can be linked back to you. We may be able to report back to you if research findings could increase
    your understanding of your health condition or change your clinical care. Not everyone who does not get a result from the initial testing will have
    their samples or information shared for further research. This will depend on whether there is a suitable research program available to look further
    into your initial testing results and/or health condition.
