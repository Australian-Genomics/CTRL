    I want to know about the genetic change if it is medically actionable
    (can alter my health management or treatment).
  description: |
    For example, there are some types of cancers that run in families.
    Sometimes we can find a genetic change that means a family is more likely
    to develop a cancer throughout their lifetime. If this genetic change is
    medically actionable, it means these families can reduce that risk through
    closer surveillance or surgical options.

    I want to know about the genetic change if it is non-medically actionable
    (will not alter my health management or treatment).
  description: |
    There are some conditions that run in families and have a genetic cause,
    but cannot be treated at this time. An example of this is early
    onset Alzheimer’s disease. This type of result would mean that you know
    that you are at risk of developing this condition,
    but at this time your health management or treatment would not change.

    I want to know if I am a carrier of a genetic change that can cause disease
    (it might affect decisions I make about having children, or for my grandchildren).
  description: |
    Sometimes we can be “carriers” of genetic changes that do not affect our
    health but can cause problems when we have a baby with a partner who also carries
    that same genetic change. An example of this is cystic fibrosis.

    I would like a summary of the main findings of my genomic testing report securely stored in CTRL,
    so I can access it at any time.
  description: |
      We are developing ways of showing your genomic results in a way that is understandable to you,
      your family and anyone else you would like to show them to.
      We will make this available to you as soon as it is ready,
      if you indicate that you would like to have it.
