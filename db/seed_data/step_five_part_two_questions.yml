  question: General research use and clinical care
  description: |
    General research use and clinical care refers to research where, for example,
    your genomic information might be shared through clinical networks
    internationally to see if there are any other cases in the world like yours.
    This is for clinical benefit, but because of the close links between clinical
    and research genomics, your genomic and other health information will
    likely also be used in a research setting.

  question: Health/medical/biomedical research
  description: |
    Health, medical and biomedical research could include research into
    understanding how a genetic change affects the functioning of a tissue or organ
    or whole-body system. It is often done in a research laboratory setting.

  question: Research must be specifically related to my condition
  description: |
    Your genomic information may be helpful to study other health conditions,
    but if you prefer, we can restrict sharing your information to research into
    your condition only.

  question: Population and ancestry research
  description: |
    Population and ancestry research may include working out how or when a certain
    genetic change arose in a population, studying traits of certain populations.
    Your information may be grouped with many other people’s information to be part
    of a control or reference dataset. This helps us to understand normal genetic
    variation in populations.
