- title: Consent for the genomic test
  order: 2
  description: |
    This section follows on from your consent to have a genomic test as
    part of the Australian Genomics study.
    Your doctor or <a href="glossary#genetic" target="_blank">genetic</a>
    counsellor will have already discussed the genomic test with you. The
    answers are all pre-selected, because you have already agreed to have the
    test.
    <br></br>
    If you choose to unselect any statements we will contact you to talk
    about whether you still consent to having the test.

    Review your consent to have a genomic test as part of the program.

- title: Consent to Australian Genomics research participation
  order: 3
  description: |
    By signing the Australian Genomics consent form, you have agreed to
    participate in the research, along with
    having the genomic test. Thank you. The research we are doing will
    help to decide whether genomic testing
    should be standard care for your health condition. To do this, we would
    like to collect information about
    you from your health records as well as information directly from you.
    The answers are all pre-selected,
    because you have already agreed to participate in the research.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you choose to unselect any statements below we will contact you to
    talk about whether
    you still agree to being in the research project.

    <b>Incidental findings:</b>
    Because a genomic test looks at many genes at once, a
    genetic change that is not related to the specific
    health condition you are being tested for could be found.
    These incidental findings may be important to know
    about for your health and for your family as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    An incidental finding is a genetic change that we know or think
    is linked with certain health conditions that the testing
    laboratory comes across accidentally, despite efforts not
    to look closely at certain genes. It is very uncommon, but
    you should be aware that it can happen.
    <br>
    <br>
    Genomic testing services have their own policies about whether
    they will tell you about incidental findings.
    If your testing is transferred to a research setting they may
    identify incidental findings. For those that
    do return incidental findings, we would like to know your preferences.

    Tell us your preferences for knowing results that fall outside the main
    reason you are having a genomic test.

- title: Consent to research outside this study
  order: 5
  description: |
    Genomic testing is not yet routinely done and we still donâ€™t know a
    lot about genetic changes that cause
    health conditions. Sometimes we would like to share your DNA sample,
    your genomic information or your
    general health information with other researchers in Australia and
    internationally. We will only share this
    information with researchers whose projects meet our criteria and
    have been approved by a Human Research
    Ethics Committee (HREC). A HREC is a group of medical, scientific
    and ethics experts, as well as members of
    the public, who look closely at planned research to make sure it
    is going to be beneficial and not harmful
    to participants.
    <br>
    <br>
    We will remove your personal details from your DNA sample, genomic and
    health information (de-identify
    them), but there always remains a small chance someone could work out
    who you are from your genomic
    information.
    <br>
    <br>
    De-identified samples are coded and so it remains possible to re-identify you.
    We will keep the
    re-identification code with us, it will not be shared. By keeping the code,
    it means that in some cases we
    may be able to contact you if the research finds something that will
    benefit you personally.
    <br>
    <br>
    Whether we share this information outside the current study is your choice, and
    you can use this section to
    change your mind any time you want to. Your answers to these questions will
    not stop you having the genomic
    test.

    Decide who we can share your samples and information with,
    and for what kinds of research.
