    This section follows on from your consent to have a genomic test as
    part of the Australian Genomics study.
    Your doctor or genetic counsellor will have already discussed the
    genomic test with you. The answers are all
    pre-selected, because you have already agreed to have the test.

    Review your consent to have a genomic test as part of the program.

- title: Consent to Australian Genomics research participation
  order: 3
  description: |
    By signing the Australian Genomics consent form, you have agreed to
    participate in the research, along with
    having the genomic test. Thank you. The research we are doing will
    help to decide whether genomic testing
    should be standard care for your health condition. To do this, we would
    like to collect information about
    you from your health records as well as information directly from you.
    The answers are all pre-selected,
    because you have already agreed to participate in the research.

    <b>Incidental findings:</b>
    Because a genomic test looks at many genes at once, a
    genetic change that is not related to the specific
    health condition you are being tested for could be found.
    These incidental findings may be important to know
    about for your health and for your family as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    An incidental finding is a genetic change that we know or think
    is linked with certain health conditions that the testing
    laboratory comes across accidentally, despite efforts not
    to look closely at certain genes. It is very uncommon, but
    you should be aware that it can happen.
    <br>
    <br>
    Genomic testing services have their own policies about whether
    they will tell you about incidental findings.
    If your testing is transferred to a research setting they may
    identify incidental findings. For those that
    do return incidental findings, we would like to know your preferences.

    Tell us your preferences for knowing results that fall outside the main
    reason you are having a genomic test.

    Genomic testing is not yet routinely done and we still donâ€™t know a
    lot about genetic changes that cause
    health conditions. Sometimes we would like to share your DNA sample,
    your genomic information or your
    general health information with other researchers in Australia and
    internationally. We will only share this
    information with researchers whose projects meet our criteria and
    have been approved by a Human Research
    Ethics Committee (HREC). A HREC is a group of medical, scientific
    and ethics experts, as well as members of
    the public, who look closely at planned research to make sure it
    is going to be beneficial and not harmful
    to participants.
