    I understand I am providing a sample so that my <a href="glossary#DNA">DNA</a>
    can be extracted and all of my genes could be looked at. This is called a
    genomic test.
  description: |
    The sample you have given may have been blood, saliva, skin or other sample already
    collected as part of your medical care. These samples contain your cells, and your DNA
    can be extracted from the cells. Your DNA is needed for the genomic test.
    DNA makes up genes. Genes are inside almost every cell of your body.
    There are over 20,000 genes in each of your cells, and together these genes
    make up your “genome”.  Each gene has a specific function, however
    the function of every gene is not yet known. Everyone has different
    variations within their genes, which is why we are all unique. Most variations are harmless,
    but other variations can change how a gene works, which might cause a health condition.
    Identifying variations may help to find the cause of your health condition. Previously,
    testing to look for variations in genes involved looking at only one gene at a time.
    New technology means we can now look at many or all of our genes at once.
    This is known as “genomic testing”.

  question: |
    I understand having a genomic test may not find the genetic cause of my condition.
  description: |
    The likelihood of finding a genetic cause depends on a number of things, including your health condition
    and how much is already known about it. We are still learning about what genes do and how they work.
    Between 30 and 50% of patients with rare disease receive a diagnosis through genomic
    testing. That is, 3 to 5 people in every 10 tested will receive a genetic explanation
    for their condition. We expect more patients will receive a diagnosis in the future,
    as the technology and our ability to interpret genomic information improve.

  question: |
    I understand my sample and genomic information will be stored by the testing laboratory
    so that it could be looked at again in the future, when we know more about genes that cause my
    health condition.
  description: |
    Your sample will be stored in the laboratory for at least 3 months. Depending on the laboratory
    and the law, it may be stored many years after this.
    The laboratory will also keep the genomic information they obtain from your sample.
    This allows for future re-analysis (looking at your genomic information again)
    if there is a specific reason or request to do so. For example, this might be done
    if new gene variants linked with your health condition are identified.

    I understand my genomic test results are confidential and will only be shared with the
    medical team directly involved in my care.
  description: |
    This could include your Clinical Geneticist and other specialist doctors,
    your Genetic Counsellor or your GP. Agreeing to participate in the
    Australian Genomics research means your results will be shared with relevant investigators on the study.
    Your result may be included in your My Health Record, if you have one.

  question: |
    I understand that the testing laboratory could share my anonymous genomic
    information with other laboratories, in order to understand more about the genetic changes
    that can cause my health condition or other conditions.
  description: |
    Anonymous means that your personal details have been removed,
    so it cannot be easily identified as yours. This kind of sharing is done to benefit research,
    but means that you will probably not personally benefit
    from anything that is discovered from sharing your information.

  question: |
    I understand the laboratory performing my test will store and may sometimes use my
    DNA sample for purposes like reference and control material.
  description: |
    Your DNA is stored in the testing laboratory for at least three months,
    but it could be years. When doing any laboratory test, it is important to compare the
    test sample with a control sample. Your DNA may be used as a control sample.
    All of your personal, identifying information will be removed if your sample is used for this purpose.

  question: |
    I understand there are certain risks involved in having a genomic test.
    These could include finding out something that may be important for my family’s health,
    incidental findings, or having to disclose the genomic information.
  description: |
    The main risks involved in having a genomic test are related to the information that
    you may get, rather than any physical harm.
    For example: <ul><li>Waiting for the test results, or the results you receive, may bring up
    a number of different emotions.</li><li>We may be uncertain about what your result means.
    </li><li>It may be uncomfortable or stressful to share a result with your family.</li><li>
    The test may find something important to your health that you or the doctors were not expecting.
    This is called an incidental finding. You will be given the opportunity to give your preferences about
    incidental findings in step 4.</li><li>You may have to disclose the information to insurance companies
    or employers. There is more information on this in the next question.</li></ul>

    I understand that if I am taking out a new policy for life, critical illness or income protection insurance,
    the insurer may ask me to disclose that I have had a genetic test and require me to provide my results.

    How insurance companies use personal genetic information is currently
    being investigated by government. If you would like more information about

    I understand my employer, or future employers, may ask for my results to decide whether there
    is a risk associated with a particular job role.
  description: |
    The law allows an employer to ask for your health details,
    including genetic testing results, if they think it is relevant in
    deciding whether you are able to fulfil a job role.
    In reality, very few employers do ask for your genetic testing results,
    but it's important that you know it may become more relevant in the future.
