        question: |
          I understand I am providing a sample so that my
          <a href="glossary#DNA" target="_blank">DNA</a> can be extracted and all of
          my genes could be looked at. This is called a genomic test.
        description: |
          The sample you have given may have been blood, saliva, skin or other sample already
          collected as part of your medical care. These samples contain your cells, and your DNA
          can be extracted from the cells. Your DNA is needed for the genomic test.
          DNA makes up genes. Genes are inside almost every cell of your body.
          There are over 20,000 genes in each of your cells, and together these genes
          make up your “genome”.  Each gene has a specific function, however
          the function of every gene is not yet known. Everyone has different
          variations within their genes, which is why we are all unique. Most variations are harmless,
          but other variations can change how a gene works, which might cause a health condition.
          Identifying variations may help to find the cause of your health condition. Previously,
          testing to look for variations in genes involved looking at only one gene at a time.
          New technology means we can now look at many or all of our genes at once.
          This is known as “genomic testing”.

        question: 'I understand having a genomic test may not find the genetic cause
          of my condition.

'
        description: |
          The likelihood of finding a genetic cause depends on a number of things, including your health condition
          and how much is already known about it. We are still learning about what genes do and how they work.
          Between 30 and 50% of patients with rare disease receive a diagnosis through genomic
          testing. That is, 3 to 5 people in every 10 tested will receive a genetic explanation
          for their condition. We expect more patients will receive a diagnosis in the future,
          as the technology and our ability to interpret genomic information improve.

        description: |
          Your sample will be stored in the laboratory for at least 3 months. Depending on the laboratory
          and the law, it may be stored many years after this.
          The laboratory will also keep the genomic information they obtain from your sample.
          This allows for future re-analysis (looking at your genomic information again)
          if there is a specific reason or request to do so. For example, this might be done
          if new gene variants linked with your health condition are identified.

          These could include finding out something that may be important for my family’s health,
          incidental findings, or having to disclose the genomic information.
        description: |
          The main risks involved in having a genomic test are related to the information that
          you may get, rather than any physical harm.
          For example: <ul><li>Waiting for the test results, or the results you receive, may bring up
          a number of different emotions.</li><li>We may be uncertain about what your result means.
          </li><li>It may be uncomfortable or stressful to share a result with your family.</li><li>
          The test may find something important to your health that you or the doctors were not expecting.

    title: Preferences about your results
    description: |
      <b>Incidental findings:</b>
      Because a genomic test looks at many genes at once, a
      genetic change that is not related to the specific
      health condition you are being tested for could be found.
      These incidental findings may be important to know
      about for your health and for your family as well.
      <br>
      <br>
      An incidental finding is a genetic change that we know or think
      is linked with certain health conditions that the testing
      laboratory comes across accidentally, despite efforts not
      to look closely at certain genes. It is very uncommon, but
      you should be aware that it can happen.
      <br>
      <br>
      Genomic testing services have their own policies about whether
      they will tell you about incidental findings.
      If your testing is transferred to a research setting they may
      identify incidental findings. For those that
      do return incidental findings, we would like to know your preferences.

    title: Consent to research outside this study
    description: |
      Genomic testing is not yet routinely done and we still don’t know a
      lot about genetic changes that cause
      health conditions. Sometimes we would like to share your DNA sample,
      your genomic information or your
      general health information with other researchers in Australia and
      internationally. We will only share this
      information with researchers whose projects meet our criteria and
      have been approved by a Human Research
      Ethics Committee (HREC). A HREC is a group of medical, scientific
      and ethics experts, as well as members of
      the public, who look closely at planned research to make sure it
      is going to be beneficial and not harmful
      to participants.
      <br>
      <br>
      We will remove your personal details from your DNA sample, genomic and
      health information (de-identify
      them), but there always remains a small chance someone could work out
      who you are from your genomic
      information.
      <br>
      <br>
      De-identified samples are coded and so it remains possible to re-identify you.
      We will keep the
      re-identification code with us, it will not be shared. By keeping the code,
      it means that in some cases we
      may be able to contact you if the research finds something that will
      benefit you personally.
      <br>
      <br>
      Whether we share this information outside the current study is your choice, and
      you can use this section to
      change your mind any time you want to. Your answers to these questions will
      not stop you having the genomic
      test.

        question: General research use and clinical care
        description: |
          General research use and clinical care refers to research where, for example,
          your genomic information might be shared through clinical networks
          internationally to see if there are any other cases in the world like yours.
          This is for clinical benefit, but because of the close links between clinical
          and research genomics, your genomic and other health information will
          likely also be used in a research setting.

          or whole-body system. It is often done in a research laboratory setting.

        description: |
          Population and ancestry research may include working out how or when a certain
          genetic change arose in a population, studying traits of certain populations.
          Your information may be grouped with many other people’s information to be part
          of a control or reference dataset. This helps us to understand normal genetic
          variation in populations.
