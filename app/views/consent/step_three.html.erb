            By signing the Australian Genomics consent form, you have agreed to participate in the research, alongside
            having the genomic test. The research we are doing will help to decide whether genomic testing should be
            offered as standard care for your health condition. To do this, we would like to collect information about
            you from your health records and information directly from you. The answers are all pre-selected, meaning
            that you understand and agree to participate in the research. If you uncheck any statements below we will
            contact you to talk about whether you still agree to being in the research project.

              We will ask the Commonwealth Government Department of Health for your Medical Benefit Scheme (MBS) and
              Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) information, covering a period of up to 8 years.
              We will ask Data Linkage agencies in each State or Territory of Australia for your hospital inpatient
              records and emergency visit records. This information will cover a period of up to 14 years.
              This information will be very important for us to understand how having a genomic test and a genomic
              diagnosis might reduce the long-term costs of health care for the government. Access to the information is
              tightly regulated to protect your privacy, and we only receive it after applying for it through the proper
              channels. We will also be required to destroy it after we finished using it.

              The surveys and questionnaires will be very important for us to understand aspects like your views of
              genomic testing, your understanding of genomic testing, your personal experiences of the test and the
              financial cost to you of having the test. Sometimes, we also ask you questions about the financial costs
              of having a health condition.
